Predicting PM2.5 Concentrations Using Hybrid Attention-based CNN-LSTM: A Federated Learning Approach


## Run test notebooks directly

First run the tests with public data in `PM2.5_predictions_public_data.ipynb`. Then predict the missing values of private data by running `PM2.5_test_private_data.ipynb`. Finally we train and predict on private data `PM2.5_predictions_private_data.ipynb`
